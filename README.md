# Human lymphoma proteomics
<br>
This repository documents the normalized count matrix generated in our proteomics study on human lymphoma (Phenomics 2023). <br><br>
This matrix is a protein-by-sample matrix, containing 109 patient samples of different lymphoma subtypes (including B-NHL, T-NHL, lymphadenitis, tumor metastatic and non-neoplastic lymph node) and 2486 proteins, which were characterized by untargeted proteomics with DIA-MS. <br><br>
